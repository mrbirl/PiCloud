My final year project - 
A home server application and corresponding client software which synchronises Dropbox, Google Drive and multiple folders on the client machine.

To run: 

- Install the Dropbox and Drive API's on a linux server
- Upload the server application files to the server
- Change paths in server application file to reflect paths on your server
- Add Dropbox and Drive app keys to Auth files

- Install PyCrypto on your client machine
- Change paths in main.py to the paths on your local machine you want to monitor
- Add your servers SFTP connection details to connectDriver.py

- Run server applications main.py
- Authenticate your Dropbox and Drive accounts when prompted
- Run client main.py

Enjoy!

Note: this is still in early stage development - nothing catastrophic should happen, but nonetheless use at your own risk :)
